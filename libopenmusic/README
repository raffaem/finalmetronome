WARNING: This is only a TRUNCATED version of libopenmusic. This is not libopenmusic, these are only 2 of the multiple files wich are part of libopenmusic.
These 2 files are included here only for convenience, because they are used by FinalMetronome, so you cannot compile FinalMetronome without these 2 files.

The real libopenmusic (wich include a lot more files than these two) is currently under active development.
