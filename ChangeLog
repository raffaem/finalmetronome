> update library
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

08/01/2011 - version 0.0.8
+ Added INSTALL.linux help file in source distribution
+ Added a fmod_getver program. This will allow to detect the fmod version and so to build the correct library string (like libfmodex-4.32.06.so) without user intervention. Before it was necessary to hardcode the fmod version in src/Makefile.am
+ Added ogg_drumset with the midi files encoded as ogg for all platform. Removed midi_drumset folder (ogg files are playable easier on linux. ogg files are now also default on windows)
* Window background image drawing was broken (a code commented out for debug purpose was still commented out)

21/08/2010 - version 0.0.7
+ POSIX timer implementation
+ Add RPATH using the -rpath option
* Segmentation fault at program termination
* Errors while calling GUI functions from other threads (custom events implemented instead)
* Numerous of bugs fixed

24/05/2010 - Version 0.0.6
+ First linux version using the autotools suite

18/04/2010 - Version 0.0.5
+ Full support for Unicode added
+ Windows only: change process priority to above normal
+ Implemented output type selection in the xml config file
+ Implemented "Tap tempo" button
+ Added a "silent sound" named "No sound". This will allow to play no sounds at a beat, so this will allow to set pauses
+ In the beat map, it is now possible to select multiple beats and change them all simultaneously
+ Changes in config.xml, see it for deatils
+ Implemented beat subdivisions, in the beat map these are named properly
+ Name changed to Final Metronome, because another project was already named Open Metronome and it was born before this project. This will avoid confusion, also for the search engines
+ Update the "Beats per minutes" option now update the beat map window also, if it is opened

15.26 09/04/2010 - Version 0.0.4
+ Created a version that do not need the Base Pack. This version is compiled under MingW and the executable is then compressed with UPX (--best option)
+ A sound->beat map implemented with a button and a window that show it and allow its modification. Now you can select a different sound for every different beat (of course multiple different beats can share the same sound)
+ Licence changed from LGPL to GPL
+ Changed sound->accents to sounds->data in config file. Subnodes changed as well. Now the amount of sound files you can load are limited only by your system memory (in the previous version, only 2  audio files can be loaded)
+ Improved FMOD initialization sequence. Useful expecially on Windows platforms.
+ Put some midi files with common drums sound in a data/midi_drumset folder
+ High resolution timer implemented (Windows only)
* FMOD would return a file not found error if the sound path string contained space at the beginning or at the end

17.14 03/04/2010 - Version 0.0.3
* "Beats in a measure" was initialized to 1. Workaround applied, need to investigate more on this, thought
* Audio stopped playing after some time
* Tempos wich were not pair caused the metronome animation to work incorrectly
