*** UNIX/LINUX GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ***

The linux version is still experimental and in alpha stage. I cannot get MIDI work at this point jet, so for this linux release MIDI support was disabled. 
If you want to try MIDI by yourself, open config.xml file and uncomment this line: "<file wildcard="true"> /midi_drumset/*.* </file>"
